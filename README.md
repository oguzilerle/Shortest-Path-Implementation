# Shortest-Path-Implementation
Jimmy needs to get his Master's thesis signed by three people to complete his degree. One of those people is his supervisor. Other two are Prof.X and Prof.Y. However, he doesn't have much time left. Jimmy needs to visit all three of the professors to get signatures and then leave the completely signed thesis at his supervisor as soon as possible. If he does not he will be expelled from his university and won't get his degree. He knows that if he takes the shortest route from his house to his supervisor, visiting Prof. X and Y along the way he can get it done. Jimmy lives in a city with N houses. Each house is numbered from 0 to N-1. Each house is connected to another one by a road and there are M roads in the city. Each road can be travelled in both directions. Moreover, travelling each road takes T minutes. Jimmy 's house no is S, his supervisor's house no is D, Prof.X's house no is X and Prof.Y's house no is Y. So, algorithm finds the quickest route from S that ends in D which also visits X and Y at least once  in any order. Additionally, Jimmy  can visit a house (including S, D, X, and Y) multiple times.
